# rag_for_circuit_analysis
A GenAI-powered RAG assistant built on Fundamentals of Electric Circuits for answering textbook-based questions using embeddings, ChromaDB, and Gemini API.
# 🔌 CircuitRAG — GenAI-Powered Textbook Assistant

CircuitRAG is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) assistant powered by Google's Gemini API. It answers questions based on the *Fundamentals of Electric Circuits* textbook by Charles K. Alexander and Matthew N. O. Sadiku. Built as part of the **Google x Kaggle GenAI Intensive Capstone 2025Q1**, it showcases semantic search, document understanding, and structured response generation.

## 🚀 Features

- 📘 Chapter-wise text chunking and metadata tagging
- 🧠 Embeddings via `models/text-embedding-004`
- 🗃️ Vector storage with ChromaDB
- 🔍 Semantic search and document retrieval
- 🧾 Structured JSON outputs
- 📄 Chapter summaries via function calling

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- Google Gemini API (Pro + Embeddings)
- ChromaDB
- Python 3.11+
- PyMuPDF (for PDF parsing, optional)
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📦 How It Works
1. **Clean & Chunk:** Preprocess the textbook and chunk it by chapter
2. **Embed:** Convert each chunk into embeddings using Gemini
3. **Store:** Save them with metadata in ChromaDB
4. **Query:** Use user questions to retrieve similar chunks
5. **Generate:** Prompt Gemini to answer using only the retrieved content
